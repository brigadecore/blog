Good day, Brigadiers!

Today, we just want to make sure everyone knows about the new "Brigade in 5 Minutes" series we recently launched on our YouTube channel at [youtube.brigade.sh](https://youtube.brigade.sh) -- that's five minutes plus or minus a couple minutes. ðŸ˜†

So why this format? Well... we're busy... you're busy... and shorter content is quicker both to produce and to consume, so all of us can get on with our day!

Our inaugural episode is a video adaptation of our [QuickStart documentation](https://quickstart.brigade.sh). Watch it below or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFyvYOjm6zc). Either way, don't forget to like and subscribe!

Remember, you can always find the maintainers on [the #brigade channel on the Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.brigade.sh) if you've got any questions for us or want to offer us some feedback!
