Hello, Brigadiers!

If you're doing something interesting with Brigade, we want to hear from you --
and so does the community, so today we wanted to advertise that guest bloggers
(and vloggers) are welcome!

We're actively seeking contributions both to this blog and to our series of
short videos, ["Brigade in Five Minutes."](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUfRhEZrmeaSWQCvOSs3bbq1NpbSVCW6v)

If you're interested, reach out to the maintainers via email at
[cncf-brigade-maintainers@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-brigade-maintainers@lists.cncf.io)
or, as always, find us in
[the #brigade channel on the Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.brigade.sh).

We're looking forward to seeing and sharing the great things our community is
doing!
