Good day, Brigadiers!

We're weirdly excited to announce this. As of this morning, the Brigade CLI --
`brig` -- can be installed on Macs (and Linux also) using the ever-popular 
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager!

If you have Homebrew installed, just type `brew install brigade-cli` and in
almost no time at all you'll be ready to connect to a Brigade API server!

Give it a shot! And, of course, head on over to our
[QuickStart](https://quickstart.brigade.sh) or find us on
[Slack](https://slack.brigade.sh) if you need more help getting started!
