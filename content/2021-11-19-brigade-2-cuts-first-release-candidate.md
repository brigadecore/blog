We have exciting news, Brigadiers!

Yesterday afternoon, maintainers cut the first Brigade 2 release candidate. This release candidate ([v2.0.0-rc.1](https://github.com/brigadecore/brigade/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.1)) also marks Brigade 2's transition from serving the v2 beta API to serving the _stable_ v2 API. With this new level of stability, there's never been a better time to get started with Brigade 2, so please do consider heading over to our recently refreshed [QuickStart](https://v2--brigade-docs.netlify.app/intro/quickstart/) and taking us for a spin.

The transition to the stable API means previous versions of gateways and other peripherals are not compatible with this release candidate, but as of this morning, we have _also_ transitioned every one of those projects to the stable API and cut a beta release of each. (They each currently remain at a beta level of maturity despite Brigade 2 itself having advanced to a release candidate.)

Barring any major surprises, we anticipate the only PRs merged between now and December 1 will be release-oriented chores, so we're targeting that date for our GA release -- just in time for the holiday season!

Following the Brigade 2 GA release, maintainers will begin putting the finishing touches on all our peripherals and will release each of those individually as they reach maturity, with the GitHub gateway almost certainly being the first.

Last, but certainly not least, we also want to thank [Jorge Arteiro](https://github.com/jorgearteiro) for recently stepping up to start reviewing chore-type PRs across all our repos!

Lately, it seems we have exciting news for you almost every day, so be sure to check back soon!
