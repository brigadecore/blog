Welcome back from the weekend, Brigadiers!

We're sure many of you are attending
[KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/)
this week and we wanted to kick off this eventful week by announcing our v2.5.0
release! This one packs a real punch because it features an all-new, but 100%
backwards compatible implementation of our Git Initializer component to correct
our recently discovered incompatibility with Git repositories hosted on
[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/). And while
Azure DevOps compatibility is a great improvement in and of itself, the new
implementation should also be more efficient for certain cases because it never
fetches more than what it needs from your remote repositories.

And with that, we're charging full steam ahead into KubeCon! Be on the lookout
for more of our peripheral components (like event gateways) going GA this week,
and if you're registered for KubeCon, be sure to join us for our virtual office
hours 3:30 - 4:15 PM, Central European Time.

Last, but not least, remember you can always find the maintainers on
[the #brigade channel on the Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.brigade.sh) if you
have questions or need help getting started. We're always happy to chat!
