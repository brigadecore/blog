Hello, Brigadiers!

If you're doing something interesting with Brigade, we want to hear from you --
and so does the community, so today we wanted to put the call out for
community-generated content both for this blog and
[our YouTube channel](https://youtube.brigade.sh). If you're interested in
contributing to either, reach out to the maintainers via email at
[cncf-brigade-maintainers@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-brigade-maintainers@lists.cncf.io)
or, as always, find us in
[the #brigade channel on the Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.brigade.sh).

We're looking forward to seeing and sharing the great things our community is
doing!
